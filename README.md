## Portfolio Website For Developers ðŸ’¯

**UPDATE:**

1. Included the `constants` folder, where you can directly add your details and they'll get reflected throughout the application. No more customizations for the template requiredâ€”just add your data and it will update automatically.

This portfolio website is a simple and minimalistic platform to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Kevin Clark](https://kevinclark.ca). The website is completely Open Source, and you can use it for whatever purpose you want.
